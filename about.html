        <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
        <p>At Skyfit, we believe that fitness is more than just a workout-it's a journey of self <br>
         improvement, both physically and mentally. Founded on this philosophy, we've <br>
         built a space where every member can push their limits, build confidence, and <br>
          enjoy the process along the way.
        </p><br>

          <p>Our gym is not a place to exercise, but an experience. Architecturally designed <br>
             to inspire, Skyfit offers a unique atmosphere with panoramic views of the vibrant <br>
             Lagos skyline and serene waterfront. Whether you're lifting weights, running on <br>
             the treadmoll, or taking a group class, you'll do with the city's beauty as your <br>
             backdrop -making every session as motivating as it is satisfying.</p>
